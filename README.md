# PYGAME - Cat&Rat

## Game Rules
  1. A two player game, player 1 being the pursuer (The Cat). Player two being the runner(The Rat).
  2. The cat uses arrow keys for movement
  3. The rat uses letters (W,A,S,D) for movement
  4. Goal of the cat is to catch the rat.
  5. Cat is relatively slower than the rat, so plan your moves strategically.
## Game Mechanics
  1. The game is made using pygame.
  2. Methods/Functions have been created for the movement of the cat and the rat.
  3. The source code is stored in the main.py file, feel free to refer to it.


#### Future plans:
  1. I intend to add a bullet fire function.
  2. The bullet fire function will add an ability to the cat to fire bullets in all directions. Depending on the user experience, the bullet may stun the rat or kill the rat.
  3. Will increase the speed of the rat once testing of the bullet fire function is done. `
